Requested fields (exact keys):
{wanted_json_array}

{desc_block}RULES (follow exactly):
1. Output: A SINGLE compact JSON object and NOTHING else.
   Example: {"incident_type":{"value":"Fire","confidence":0.92}}.
2. The JSON MUST contain EXACTLY the keys listed above (same spelling).
3. Each key's value MUST be an object containing:
   - "value": the extracted text as a string (or "" if not found)
   - "confidence": a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing certainty
4. Do NOT add any keys other than "value" and "confidence" for each field.
5. Keep values short and factual (one line). Collapse newlines and excessive whitespace into single spaces.
6. Booleans -> "true"/"false". Numbers -> string (e.g., "3"). Lists -> items joined by "; ".
7. If multiple candidates exist, choose the first clear explicit mention.
8. Output must be compact (single line).

EXAMPLE:
Transcript: "There was a brush fire in Los Angeles that displaced three people."
Expected JSON:
{
  "incident_final_type": {"value": "fire", "confidence": 0.95},
  "incident_location": {"value": "Los Angeles", "confidence": 0.9},
  "incident_displaced_number": {"value": "3", "confidence": 0.92}
}
